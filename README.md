# Pokemon Memory Card

## Description

This Memory game uses PokeAPI to generate clickable cards. The cards shuffle after each click. If the user clicks the same card twice the game is over. On the other hand if the user clears a board, the number of cards will increase by 5. A high score is saved locally, to keep track of progress and adds competitiveness.
